# Coffee Bean Sales

In this project I created a simple-to-understand coffee sales dashboard to show the amount of sales generated from years 2019 through 2022 for the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.


## Project Overview
1. Review the companies raw data sheet, the sheet contains a orders tab, customers tab and products tab.
2. Make a copy of the orders sheet, and rename the original sheet as orders_raw.
3. Gather the customer data using XLOOKUP: columns Customer Name, Email and Country
4. Gather the products data using INDEX MATCH: column Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size and Unit Price 
5. Populate the Sales column with a very simple mulriplication formula: multiply the Unit Price with the Quantity.
6. Create a new column that has the full coffee type name and roast type name by writing multiple IF statements: column names will be Coffee Type Name and Roast Type Name
7. Format the order date column as the following: 01-Jan-2023, this will help the end user know the exact date no matter where they are located.
